				<h2>Victoria: When I say "graphic designer" what is the first thing that comes to mind?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>Ian: Myself, I think? Not a very inspiring thought. I need to change that.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>V: What is a graphic designer to you?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I: A graphic designer is someone whose practice involves giving form to communication—using language to create visual objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>V: What is your definition of a graphic designer?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I: Someone who employs point, line, plane, colour, image, type, and space to create meaningful works of visual communication for a variety of targets and media.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>V: What roles does a graphic designer today have?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I: Conceptualizing, researching, collaborating, experimenting, playing, reading, writing, reiterating, organizing, reorganizing, more researching, critiquing, analyzing, absorbing, understanding, learning, growing, teaching, more researching, and sometimes designing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>V: What opportunities does a graphic designer have today that they didn't have 10, 20, 30 years ago?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I: See: any new technological innovation of the past 30 years. A few obvious examples of new visual platforms with design opportunities resulting from recent tech developments are the web, mobile phones, applications and digital user interfaces. The history of design has always been closely tied to the history of technology.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>V: Would you ever consider being a graphic designer? If so why or why not?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I: Yes? I am a graphic designer. The appeal of graphic design for me was rooted in the personal need/desire to do work in my life that is creatively stimulating, provides opportunity to create a meaningful positive impact in my community, and is ever-evolving with new areas of design to learn and explore and new technology that allows for new forms and new experiences to be explored.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>V: How much opportunities does a graphic designer coming out of school have today?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I: This is hard to gauge and depends on a multitude of factors. Graphic design is a very broad job title that encompasses a galaxy of "specialized" roles within it, and depending on the time and place, demand for some of those may exceed others. One thing that the industry benefits from—especially right now given the global pandemic—is the ability to collaborate and work remotely on a great number of different types of design projects, and this practice is becoming increasingly common in the field which eliminates some of the physical or geography-based barriers to find work that is a good fit for both the designer and the employer/client.</p>
